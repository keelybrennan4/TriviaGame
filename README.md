Homework 5 Trivia Game
Once the user presses the start button, she has 30 seconds to answer each trivia question.

If the user times out, she is shown the correct answer and moves on to the next question. The same process happens if she is incorrect. 

The application tracks the number of correct, incorrect responses and questions that timed out. The user is shown their totals at the end of the quiz. From there, the user can opt to play again.
This is a game built using jQuery, HTML, and CSS.
